Kriole is a language full of interesting words.
I feel there are a lot of expressive words:
words with interesting metaphors,
words with just the right number of syllables,
words that leave no doubt what the speaker really thinks.
Most Kriole words are descended from Portuguese words, one way or another,
though some come from other languages.
I plan to post what I know or find out about some Kriole words I find interesting,
starting with [dezar√°]({% link crioulo/palavra/_posts/2020-06-10-dezara-dezarente.markdown %}).
