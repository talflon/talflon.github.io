I'm learning to use ALUPEC, a writing system for [Cape Verdean Creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verdean_Creole)
created by Manuel Veiga.
I'm using it specifically for the Barlavento dialect of São Vicente.
If you're looking to learn more about ALUPEC, good resources include
[Manuel Veiga's blog](https://odjudagu.blogspot.com/) and [alupec.kauberdi.org](http://alupec.kauberdi.org/), which has a copy of
its officialized rules.

This is a writing system that was designed mostly with a different dialect in mind, the Santiago dialects, for which it was to be
relatively simple and phonetic, a sort of spelling reform of traditional phonetic spellings based on Portuguese orthography.
(It was not the first attempt at this.)
The São Vicente dialect is different in a number of ways that make it difficult to represent with the same spelling rules as for Santiago.
So there are special rules for Barlavento dialects in ALUPEC.
These rules also make Barlavento dialect spellings follow their etymology more than other dialects' spellings.

The end result, in my opinion, is a bit of a Frankenstein's monster.
I'm not a linguist, and my knowledge of Creole is imperfect, but there's a lot that can be criticized.
It hasn't been well received by native Barlavento speakers, from what I've heard.

There ends up being a lot of ambiguity in how words are written vs. how they're pronounced.
For example, if you write *debóxe*, *detá*, and *dezê*, the accent marks give you some pronunciation
clues, but they leave out something important if you've never heard the words spoken: the initial E's have very different sounds,
to the point of changing the number of syllables when an E doesn't actually represent a sound at all!
For every word made simpler by using Portuguese rules for the letter S,
there seems to be two words made more ambiguous by saying "but don't duplicate them and never use C".
So some of this ambiguity is a direct result of the combinations of rules chosen,
and would be reduced if slightly different ones were used.

But a lot of the ambiguity is hard to avoid,
without using a ton of accent marks, inventing new letters,
or using a lot of apostrophes.
I tend towards liking the apostrophes a little better, but I can see that they can seem more like an eye-dialect than a spelling system.
Most every writing system has some ambiguity.
By not trying too hard to unambiguously write the pronunciation,
one can hope to have fewer ways to write the same word,
letting multiple people pronounce them differently while writing them the same.
That would be good for reading.

The system is definitely usable, and despite my criticisms I'm happy to be using it.
I've been trying to get used to the rules and how they're applied by writing
in the language and translating things into it.
I'm storing some of my thoughts, understandings, and questions on [my ALUPEC Sonsénte page]({% link crioulo/alupec-sonsente.markdown %}).
